# Mise · Staff role

Mobile-first, responsive UI for the **Staff** role of Mise, a hotel-operations
app for floor teams. Built around one persona working one shift: Maya Fernando,
Room Attendant, Housekeeping, Aurora Grand Colombo, Sunday 07:00–15:30.

## Information architecture

Five primary sections, plus screens reached from inside those flows.

| Section | Route | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Today** | `/` | Greeting, next timed task with a live progress ring and countdown, shift-rhythm timeline, supervisor presence and chat |
| **My shift** | `/shift` | Live task card, shift at a glance, the full chronological duty plan, supervisor note, handover link |
| **SOPs** | `/library` | Searchable standards library, filtered by job role or hashtag |
| **Courses** | `/courses` | Operating briefs — PDF, video and deck per brief, with an inline readiness check |
| **Service record** | `/progress` | Five-star ready score, live four-phase breakdown, supervisor comments, verified credentials |

The Courses section carries its own sub-navigation:

| | Route | |
|---|---|---|
| **Paths** | `/paths` | Locked, sequential curriculum unlocked step by step by supervisor sign-off |
| **Forums** | `/forums` | Per-SOP Q&A between staff and supervisors |
| **Feedback** | `/feedback` | Rate a brief and route a suggestion back to its author |
| **Notifications** | `/notifications` | Assignments, supervisor feedback and reminders across in-platform, email and WhatsApp |

Two staff flows sit outside the main navigation:

- **Shift handover** (`/handover`) — unfinished work, guest promises and blocked
  rooms, gated behind a pre-send checklist.
- **Service recovery** (`/service-recovery`) — the guided Listen → Acknowledge →
  Resolve → Follow up workflow, with the staff member's spend authorisation
  limit and a shared incident timeline.

## The SOP / task engine

Every standard (for example `HSK-101` Guest Room Reset & Release) carries a
target time, a fixed set of steps, and four phases: **Prepare, Perform, Verify,
Release**.

- `/sop/[id]` reviews the standard — every phase, why-it-matters callouts, demo
  clips, photo-evidence markers, and the questions others asked about it.
- `/sop/[id]/practice` is the live task runner: countdown against the target
  time, phase-by-phase checklist with running progress, demo clips inline,
  photo capture (`accept="image/*" capture="environment"`), and a line to the
  on-shift supervisor.

A step marked for photo evidence **cannot be ticked until the photo is
captured** — quality proof is a gate, not a suggestion.

## Role switching

The sidebar's top-left control is the Staff/Manager/Author switch. Only the
Staff role is built here; the other two are listed and visibly locked rather
than hidden, so the control reads honestly.

## Responsive behaviour

| Breakpoint | Layout | Navigation |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile (< 640 px) | 1-column card stack | Fixed bottom bar, condensed top identity header |
| Tablet (640–1024 px) | 2-column grid | Fixed bottom bar |
| Desktop (> 1024 px) | 3-column grid, `max-w-6xl` content | Persistent left sidebar |

Every interactive element is at least **56 × 56 px**, verified in-browser at all
three breakpoints. No page scrolls horizontally; the filter rails and Courses
sub-nav scroll inside their own containers.

## Status colours

| Colour | Class | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Red | `bg-rose-500` | Due next |
| 🟡 Amber | `bg-amber-500` | In progress |
| 🟢 Green | `bg-emerald-500` | Released / verified |
| 🔵 Blue | `bg-sky-500` | Scheduled |

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. There is no login — the app opens on Today, and
the persona is selected by the role switcher, matching the real product.

## Notes

- **No backend.** Checklist ticks, photo captures, readiness passes, read
  notifications, handover and recovery state persist to `localStorage` through
  `useSyncExternalStore`, so server and client renders agree. Replacing
  `lib/store.tsx` with a real API is the only change needed.
- **Countdowns start on mount**, seeded from a fixed value, so the first paint
  is deterministic and hydration never mismatches.
- **Light theme only**, deliberately: this is used on the floor in daylight.
